    Fast Pork Stir Fry by JOshua Weissman
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) boneless boston butt </li>
        <li>½ cup (60g) corn starch</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for cooking </li>
        <li>½ yellow onion thinly sliced </li>
        <li>1 jalapeno thinly sliced </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30g) soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (12g) sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15g) vinegar</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic finely chopped</li>
        <li>Salt to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a knife, slice the pork against the grain 1/16 of an inch thick, or as thin as possible. Optionally the pork can be placed in the freezer for about an hour to help make slicing easier. </li>
        <li>Heat a large saute pan over high heat. While the pan is heating, toss the sliced pork in corn starch until evenly coated. </li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, add vegetable oil to the pan, followed by the pork. Cook the pork for 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Add sliced onions and jalapenos to the pan, toss to combine, then cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Once the vegetables begin to soften, add soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar to the pan. Toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat on the pan, add garlic and toss the pan to combine until the garlic becomes aromatic. </li>
        <li>Plate the cooked pork into a bowl and garnish with fresh sliced jalapeno, and thinly sliced green onion. </li>
    </ol>
